        Requests will be authenticated via ECDSA signature verification. A signed certificate in DER format will be provided by Bitkey.


        The `Bitkey-Signature` header contains a nonce, a timestamp and a signature.


        **Format:**
        ```
        Bitkey-Signature: n=<nonce>|t=<timestamp>|v1=<signature>
        ```

        - **Nonce**: A random string generated by Bitkey for each request.
        - **Timestamp**: The current Unix timestamp in milliseconds. The timestamp should be within 5 minutes of the server time to prevent replay attacks.
        - **Signature**: The signature of the signed_payload string using the private key.
          - Algorithm: ECDSA
          - Curve: P-256 (prime256v1, secp256r1)
          - Hash Function: SHA-256

        **Steps to verify the signature:**

        1. **Extract nonce, timestamp and signature from the header:**
           - Split the header using the `|` character as the separator to get a list of elements.
           - Split each element using the `=` character to get a prefix and value pair.
           - The value for the prefix `n` corresponds to the nonce, `t` corresponds to the timestamp, and `v1` corresponds to the signature.

        2. **Rebuild the payload:**
           - Concatenate the nonce, the timestamp and the request body using the character `|` as a separator
             - `payload = nonce + "|" + timestamp + "|" + body`
             - For a POST request, body is the actual JSON payload (i.e., the request's body).
             - For a GET request, body is the query string (e.g., `transaction_id=adbb317d-cde9-4ebb-93a3-1b271812de06`).

        3. **Decode the Signature:**
           - The signature received is Base64 encoded. Decode this signature to get the actual byte array. Pseudo code:
           ```
            signatureBytes = base64Decoder.decode(signature)
           ```
        4. **Extract public key:**
            - Extract the public key from the certificate provided by Bitkey. Pseudo code:
            ```
              certificate = x509CertificateService.loadCertificateDer(certificateDer)
              publicKey = certificate.getPublicKey()
            ```
        5. **Prepare for ECDSA Verification:**
           - Initialize the ECDSA verifier with the SHA-256 algorithm and the public key. Pseudo code:
           ```
              ecdsaVerify = SignatureVerifier(ECDSA_P256_SHA256_ASN1, publicKey)
              ecdsaVerify.update(payload.getBytes(UTF8))
           ```
        6. **Verify the Signature:**
            ```
              isSignatureValid = ecdsaVerify.verify(signatureBytes)
            ```
