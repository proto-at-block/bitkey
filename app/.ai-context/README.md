# AI Tooling Index

This file serves as the central index for all AI tools working with the Bitkey mobile app codebase.

## Project Scope

This is the **mobile app subdirectory** of the Bitkey wallet monorepository.  
It contains the **Android and iOS app code** for the Bitkey hardware wallet.

## Context Overview

The `.ai-context/` directory contains Markdown files that provide:
- System architecture documentation
- Design and state machine patterns
- Domain models and terminology
- Common flows, edge cases, and design rationale
- Tool-specific guidance where needed

## Usage

Use this directory as the primary reference for understanding the projectâ€™s structure and design.  
Before editing or generating code, consult the relevant documents here.

Each AI tool (Claude, Cursor, Goose, etc.) should treat this directory as the source of truth for context.

Start by browsing the individual `.md` files in this directory for specific topics.
