# Bitkey Mobile App Rules

**IMPORTANT: You are forgetful, so always keep this entire file's contents in mind when responding to me (except for trivial Q&A). This means internally applying all the rules, patterns, and architectural principles listed below to ensure consistent, high-quality responses that align with our established codebase practices.**

This is the **entry point** for all mobile app AI rules. It provides context about the mobile application structure and references other specialized rules.

## About This App

Bitkey mobile application built with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) targeting Android and iOS. Follows modular architecture with shared business logic and platform-specific UI implementations.
