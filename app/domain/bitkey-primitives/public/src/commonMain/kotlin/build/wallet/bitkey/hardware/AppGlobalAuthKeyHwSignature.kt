/**
 * [AppGlobalAuthPublicKey] signed with [HwAuthPublicKey]'s private key. This is done through
 * a hardware tap. This signature has the same lifecycle as [AppGlobalAuthPublicKey] and
 * [HwAuthPublicKey]. Meaning that if the [AppGlobalAuthPublicKey] or [HwAuthPublicKey] are rotated,
 * a new signature needs to be created using new [AppGlobalAuthPublicKey] and a [HwAuthPublicKey].
 *
 * This signature is used by a PC app to be able to verify the authenticity of a TC's key
 * certificate.
 *
 * See [TrustedContactKeyCertificate] for more details.
